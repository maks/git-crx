# Git-Html5 Test App

## A Test Chrome Packaged App for the git-html5 library

## WARNING ALPHA CODE !!

this is very rough at the moment. open the js console - all the action is happening there.

to install:
* after git clone need ot git init the git-html5 submodule 
* load into chrome as "unpacked extension" [sic]

to test:
* use the Choose Dir button to select a git working dir
* in js console run `testPackRead()`
* look through final result which should be showing the diff object for the top level tree of the HEAD commit
