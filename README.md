# sj-tig 

## A Chrome Packaged App for browsing local git repositories

## WARNING VERY ALPHA CODE !!

This is very rough at the moment. 
Do **NOT** use this with any repositories you would cry about if they got deleted, corrupted or moved into an alternate universe.

## Install for testing
* after git clone need ot git init the git-html5 submodule 
* load into chrome as "unpacked extension" [sic]


## Debugging
* open the js console using Chrome dev tools - all the action is happening there.

## Usage

I've tried to key the key bindings similiar to [Tig](http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/manual.html).
